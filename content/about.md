An archival initiative focused on materials produced during the era of revolutionary politics in Senegal. These materials have been predominantly understudied due to the context of repression and clandestine politics in which they originated. Facilitating access among scholarly and non-scholarly communities allows for a reinterpretation of the present through the lens of little known past events. Individuals in possession of relevant material are encouraged to contact the website administrator.
