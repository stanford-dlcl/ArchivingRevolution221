title: Archiving Revolution 221
---

<p>Welcome to the Archiving Revolution Project (ARP). Our mission is to collect rare materials produced during the era of revolutionary politics in Senegal, along with testimonies from individuals who directly experienced these historical events. These political and cultural artifacts played an important role in the history of Senegalese democracy. Our collection encompasses a diverse array of items ranging from pamphlets, manifestos, songs, poetry anthologies, brochures, photographs, cassette tapes and periodicals, among other artifacts. By preserving and making these documents accessible, the ARP seeks to bridge the gap between older and newer acts of civic engagement. We hope that this initiative will help mend the gap in transmitting memories from 20th-century civic activism to that of the early 21st century. This gap is partly attributed to the clandestine and repressive conditions that characterized revolutionary politics in Senegal during the latter half of the 20th century. Our aspiration is that reconstructing this archive and gathering memories from that period will foster meaningful contemporary involvement with civic and democratic engagement.</p>
